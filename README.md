A simple and small `Kit` to perform awesome 360Â° flyovers on your MKMapView.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

STLocationRequest is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```bash
pod 'FlyoverKit'
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate STLocationRequest into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "SvenTiigi/FlyoverKit"
```

Run `carthage update --platform iOS` to build the framework and drag the built `FlyoverKit.framework` into your Xcode project. 

## Usage
`FlyoverKit` offers three ways to implement a flyover.

### FlyoverMapView
If you wish to show MapView which is already preconfigured to perform a flyover on a given location.

```swift
// Initialize the FlyoverMapView
let flyoverMapView = FlyoverMapView()

// Initialize a location
let eiffelTower = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(48.858370, 2.294481)

// Start flyover
flyoverMapView.start(flyover: eiffelTower)
```

### FlyoverCamera
If you already have a `MKMapView` in your `Controller` and want to add a flyover to this MapView, use the `FlyoverCamera`.

```swift
// Initialize the FlyoverCamera with a MKMapView
let flyoverCamera = FlyoverCamera(
    mapView: mapView,
    configuration: configuration
)

// Initialize a location
let eiffelTower = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(48.858370, 2.294481)

// Start flyover
flyoverCamera.start(flyover: eiffelTower)
```

### FlyoverMapViewController
If you wish to present a `UIViewController` with an embedded `FlyoverMapView` to perform a flyover on a given location.

```swift
// Initialize a location
let eiffelTower = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(48.858370, 2.294481)

// Initialize the FlyoverMapViewController with a Flyover object
let controller = FlyoverMapViewController(flyover: eiffelTower)

// Present controller
self.present(controller, animated: true)
```

## Advanced
The `FlyoverKit` is based on a 4-layer architecture:

* Flyover
* FlyoverCamera
* FlyoverMapView
* FlyoverMapViewController

## Flyover
The `flyover` protocol represents the base layer of the `FlyoverKit`. The protocol is used to perform a flyover on the given coordinate.

```swift
public protocol Flyover {
    var coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D { get }
}
```
The `FlyoverKit` already implemented this protocol to various MapKit and CoreLocation types like `CLLocationCoordinate2D`, `CLLocation`, `MKMapPoint`, `MKMapItem`, `MKCoordinateRegion` and many more.

You can apply the `Flyover` protocol to your own models to use them for a flyover.

```swift
struct Address {
    var name: String
    var coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D
}
extension Address: Flyover {}
```

## FlyoverCamera
The second layer the `FlyoverCamera` is responsible for manipulating the orginal `MKMapView` camera and performs a 360Â° flyover animation via the `UIViewPropertyAnimator`. In order to initialize a `FlyoverCamera` object you need to pass a `MKMapView` (which reference will be weakly stored) and a `FlyoverCamera.Configuration` object.

```swift
// Initialize FlyoverCamera configuration
let configuration = FlyoverCamera.Configuration(
    duration: 4.0,
    altitude: 600.0,
    pitch: 45.0,
    headingStep: 20.0
)

// Initialize FlyoverCamera
let camera = FlyoverCamera(
    mapView: mapView,
    configuration: configuration
)

// Start Flyover
camera.start(flyover: location)
```

### Configuration
The `FlyoverCamera.Configuration` struct holds all specific flyover configuration values such as

* duration
* altitude
* pitch
* headingStep
* regionChangeAnimation

Set the properties to get the right look and feel of the flyover as you need it to be.

### Configuration Theme
If you don't want to set the properties yourself your can use a preconfigured configuration theme. Currently there are four themes available 

* `default`
* `lowFlying`
* `farAway`
* `giddy`

Furthermore, you can initialize a `FlyoverCamera` with a `Theme`.

```swift
// Initialize FlyoverCamera
let camera = FlyoverCamera(
    mapView: mapView,
    configurationTheme: .default
)
```
