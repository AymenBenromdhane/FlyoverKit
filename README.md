`FlyoverKit` enables you to present stunning 360¬∞ flyover views on a `MKMapView` with zero effort while maintaining full configuration possibilities.

## FlyoverKit Example App
<img style="float: right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SvenTiigi/FlyoverKit/gh-pages/readMeAssets/FlyoverKitExampleApplication.gif" alt="Example Application Screenshot" align="right" width="307">

The `FlyoverKitExample` Application is an excellent way to see `FlyoverKit` in action. You can get a brief look of configuration options and how they change the flyover behaviour. Please keep in mind that the `SatelliteFlyover` and `HybridFlyover` will only work on a real iOS device.

In order to run the example Application you have to first generate the Frameworks via `Carthage`

```bash
$ carthage update --platform iOS
$ open FlyoverKit.xcodeproj
```

## Installation

### CocoaPods

STLocationRequest is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```bash
pod 'FlyoverKit'
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate STLocationRequest into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "SvenTiigi/FlyoverKit"
```

Run `carthage update --platform iOS` to build the framework and drag the built `FlyoverKit.framework` into your Xcode project. 

## Usage
`FlyoverKit` comes with three ways to implement a flyover. Simply choose the most suitable type for your implementation. Please see the `Advanced` section in order to configure the `FlyoverKit` to your needs.

### FlyoverCamera
If you already have a `MKMapView` in your `Controller` and you want to add a flyover to this MapView, simply use the `FlyoverCamera`.

```swift
// Initialize the FlyoverCamera with a MKMapView
let flyoverCamera = FlyoverCamera(
    mapView: mapView,
    configuration: configuration
)

// Initialize a location
let eiffelTower = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(48.858370, 2.294481)

// Start flyover
flyoverCamera.start(flyover: eiffelTower)
```

### FlyoverMapView
If you wish to show a MapView which is already preconfigured to perform a flyover on a given location.

```swift
// Initialize the FlyoverMapView
let flyoverMapView = FlyoverMapView()

// Initialize a location
let eiffelTower = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(48.858370, 2.294481)

// Start flyover
flyoverMapView.start(flyover: eiffelTower)
```

### FlyoverMapViewController
If you wish to present a `UIViewController` with an embedded `FlyoverMapView` to perform a flyover on a given location.

```swift
// Initialize a location
let eiffelTower = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(48.858370, 2.294481)

// Initialize the FlyoverMapViewController with a Flyover object
let controller = FlyoverMapViewController(flyover: eiffelTower)

// Present controller
self.present(controller, animated: true)
```

## Advanced
The `FlyoverKit` is based on a 4-layer architecture:

* Flyover
* FlyoverCamera
* FlyoverMapView
* FlyoverMapViewController

## Flyover
The `flyover` protocol represents the base layer of the `FlyoverKit`. The protocol is used to perform a flyover on the given coordinate.

```swift
public protocol Flyover {
    var coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D { get }
}
```
The `FlyoverKit` already implemented this protocol to various MapKit and CoreLocation types like `CLLocationCoordinate2D`, `CLLocation`, `MKMapPoint`, `MKMapItem`, `MKCoordinateRegion` and many more.

You can apply the `Flyover` protocol to your own models to use them for a flyover.

```swift
struct Address {
    var name: String
    var coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D
}
extension Address: Flyover {}
```

## FlyoverCamera
The second layer the `FlyoverCamera` is responsible for manipulating the orginal `MKMapView` camera and performs a 360¬∞ flyover animation via the `UIViewPropertyAnimator` class. 

In order to initialize a `FlyoverCamera` object you need to pass a `MKMapView` (which reference will be weakly stored) and a `FlyoverCamera.Configuration` object.

```swift
// Initialize FlyoverCamera configuration
let configuration = FlyoverCamera.Configuration(
    duration: 4.0,
    altitude: 600.0,
    pitch: 45.0,
    headingStep: 20.0
)

// Initialize FlyoverCamera
let camera = FlyoverCamera(
    mapView: mapView,
    configuration: configuration
)

// Start Flyover
camera.start(flyover: location)
```

### Configuration
The `FlyoverCamera.Configuration` struct holds all specific flyover configuration values. Set the properties to get the right look and feel of the flyover as you need it to be.

| Configuration      | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| duration      | The flyover animation duration |
| altitude      | The altitude above the ground, measured in meters      |
| pitch | The viewing angle of the camera, measured in degrees      |
| headingStep | The direction step in degrees that is added to the MapViewCamera heading in each flyover iteration |
| regionChangeAnimation | The region change animation that should be applied if a flyover has been started and the MapCamera has to change the region. Default is always `.none` which immediately present the place. If you wish that the region change should be performed via an animation you can set `.animated(duration: 1.5, curve: .easeIn)`      |

### Configuration Theme
If you don't want to set the properties yourself your can use a preconfigured configuration theme. Currently there are four themes available 

| Theme      | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| default      | Default flyover configuration with configuration for a default flyover usage |
| lowFlying      | Flyover configuration with a low altitude and a high pitch. Simulates a low flying helicopter viewing angle |
| farAway      | Configuration with a high altitude and a normal pitch which results in a far away viewing angle |
| giddy      | A giddy configuration ü§¢ which you shouldn't use in production. But it's fun ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ü§ô|

More themes coming soon... üë®‚Äçüíª

Furthermore, you can initialize a `FlyoverCamera` with a given `Theme`.

```swift
// Initialize FlyoverCamera
let camera = FlyoverCamera(
    mapView: mapView,
    configurationTheme: .default
)
```
